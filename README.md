All my coding stuff related to Discord bot coding

Sorry about the lack of commentaries in the codes (I find it very annoying but I always worked for myself before so I might do it now) and my coding style, I'm still young and learning from myself.

I code when I have time and motivation, so I don't know when will I upload new stuff.


I managed to do create these things thanks to RedBot's community and Pantoufle, a big up to them (There are also some parts that I took from Pantoulfle's work ^^)
